\chapter{Computability on other domains}
Since the URM is only able to manipulate $natural numbers$, our definition of computability concerns only functions and predicates on $\nat$.

The concept of computability can be extended to other domanins \dots referencing a notion (a bit unsatisfactory) of effective encoding.

Suppose that we are interested in computability on an object domain $Q$. Does our concept of computability extend to this domain? One of the conditions that are  necessary condition is that it is possible to encode the elements of $D$ as natural numbers. Suppose there exists $ \alpha: D \rightarrow \nat $, which is biunivocal and that $ \alpha, \alpha^{-1} $ are ``effective''. We can't have a formal notion of effectiveness\dots It means that everyone would agree on its calculability (if there's any justice in this world\dots)

$D$ must be countable. For example, take the strings of a certain alphabet $ \Sigma $, $ D = \Sigma^* $. The set of rational numbers $ \mathbb{Q} $ is also countable, and so is the set of integers $\mathbb{Z}$, while $D$ can't be  $ \mathbb{R} $ or $A^w$ (stream).

At this point we must ask ourselves when a function $ f: D \rightarrow D $ is URM-computable. And the answer to this question is: When its encoding $ f: \nat \rightarrow \nat $ is computable.

$ f^*: \nat \rightarrow \nat $\\
$ f^* = \alpha . f . \alpha^{-1} $

We will see that if $\alpha$ is effective, its' inverse is also effective.

\textbf{Note:} The pb realtive to the informality of the effectivity notion remains, but once this has been accepted, the rest is formal.

\textbf{Example}: to work on signed numbers I need $ \alpha: \mathbb{Z} \rightarrow \nat $, one way for this coding is:

$ \alpha(z) = \begin{cases}
  2z    & z \geq 0 \\
  -2z-1 & z < 0
\end{cases} $

Which is an effective function with the inverse;

$ \alpha^{-1}(z) = \begin{cases}
  \frac{1}{2}n     & n $ is even $ \\
  \frac{-(n+1)}{2} & n $ is odd $
\end{cases} $

Let's see an example of a computable function, abs (z) = $ |z| $. It is computable if it is $ f^*: \nat \rightarrow \nat = \alpha f \alpha^{-1}(n) $ = $
\begin{cases}
  \alpha f(\frac{n}{2}) = \alpha(\frac{n}{2})= n & n $ even $ \\
  \alpha f(-\frac{n+1}{2}) = \alpha (\frac{n+1}{2}) = n+1
\end{cases}
$

therefore

$ f^*(n) = \begin{cases}
  n   & $ if n is even $ \\
  n+1 & $ if n is odd $
\end{cases} $

it is computable.
